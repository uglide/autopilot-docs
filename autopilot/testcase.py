"""
Quick Start
===========

The :class:`AutopilotTestCase` is the main class test authors will be
interacting with. Every autopilot test case should derive from this class.
:class:`AutopilotTestCase` derives from :class:`testtools.TestCase`, so test
authors can use all the methods defined in that class as well.

**Writing tests**

Tests must be named: ``test_<testname>``, where *<testname>* is the name of the
test. Test runners (including autopilot itself) look for methods with this
naming convention. It is recommended that you make your test names descriptive
of what each test is testing. For example, possible test names include::

    test_ctrl_p_opens_print_dialog
    test_dash_remembers_maximized_state

**Launching the Application Under Test**

If you are writing a test for an application, you need to use the
:meth:`~AutopilotTestCase.launch_test_application` method. This will launch the
application, enable introspection, and return a proxy object representing the
root of the application introspection tree.

        application.

        Use this method to launch an application and start testing it. The
        positional arguments are used as arguments to the application to lanch.
        Keyword arguments are used to control the manner in which the
        application is launched.

        This method is designed to be flexible enough to launch all supported
        types of applications. Autopilot can automatically determine how to
        enable introspection support for dynamically linked binary
        applications. For example, to launch a binary Gtk application, a test
        might start with::

            app_proxy = self.launch_test_application('gedit')

        Applications can be given command line arguments by supplying
        positional arguments to this method. For example, if we want to launch
        ``gedit`` with a certain document loaded, we might do this::

            app_proxy = self.launch_test_application(
                'gedit', '/tmp/test-document.txt')

        ... a Qt5 Qml application is launched in a similar fashion::

            app_proxy = self.launch_test_application(
                'qmlscene', 'my_scene.qml')

        If you wish to launch an application that is not a dynamically linked
        binary, you must specify the application type. For example, a Qt4
        python application might be launched like this::

            app_proxy = self.launch_test_application(
                'my_qt_app.py', app_type='qt')

        Similarly, a python/Gtk application is launched like so::

            app_proxy = self.launch_test_application(
                'my_gtk_app.py', app_type='gtk')

        :param application: The application to launch. The application can be
            specified as:

               (``/usr/bin/gedit``)
             * A relative path to an executable file.
               (``./build/my_app``)
             * An app name, which will be searched for in $PATH (``my_app``)

        :keyword app_type: If set, provides a hint to autopilot as to which
            kind of introspection to enable. This is needed when the

            insensitive.

            will be launched from that directory.
